- 👋 Hi, I’m @chowps or Pei-Sze Chow, PhD. I'm an Assistant Professor of Media and Culture at the University of Amsterdam (NL).
- 👀 I’m interested in all things relating to screen studies (film, TV), particularly the cinemas of small nations and now, the use of AI-powered tools in film production.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use GitHub Pages to create a website featuring my academic research activities and output. 
- 💞️ Right now, I’m looking to collaborate on research projects examining the impact of AI-driven decision-making tools in film industries across Europe, East Asia, and South-East Asia.
- 📫 Contact me at p.s.chow@uva.nl.
